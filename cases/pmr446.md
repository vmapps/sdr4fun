# PMR446 decoding

PMR446 decoding is about receiving a PMR446 signal on **446 MHz** and extracting the information it carries, usually voice and sometimes extra signalling data.

### Introduction

PMR446 (Personal/Private Mobile Radio) is a licence‑free walkie‑talkie service in Europe that uses frequencies around **446 MHz**.

It was designed for short‑range communication (families, small businesses, events) with low power and fixed antennas.

## Decoding PMR446

Decoding analogue PMR446 signal means :

- Demodulating narrow‑band FM so you can hear the voice.
- Detecting and interpreting sub‑audio tones (CTCSS) or digital codes (DCS) that act as “privacy codes” to mute other users on the same channel.

Decoding digital PMR446 signal means :

- Demodulating the 4‑level FSK digital signal on the 446 MHz channels.
- Decoding the digital voice (vocoder) plus signalling like colour codes, talkgroups and IDs that separate user groups on the same frequency.

### Practical decoding

A simple PMR446 walkie‑talkie “decodes” automatically: it takes the RF signal, demodulates it, checks the right CTCSS/DCS or colour code/talkgroup, and plays audio only if it matches.

A scanner or SDR connected to a PC can decode PMR446 by tuning to **446 MHz**, applying the correct demodulation (FM or digital), then showing or playing the decoded audio and metadata (codes, talkgroups, IDs).

### Quick tutorial for analogue signals

- run `gqrx` software defined radio
- search for active frequency around `446.000 Mhz`
- select NFM decoding mode

### Quick tutorial for digital signals

- run `gqrx` software defined radio
- search for active frequency around `466.000 Mhz`
- select NFM decoding mode
- stream output to `localhost`using `UDP`
- run `netcat` to forward UDP traffic to `dsd`

  `ncat -l -u -p 73355 | dsd -i - -o pa:1`

- if you get error message such as `Unknown burst type: 1101`, try changing `NFM` decoder settings :

  ```
  max_dev = 25kHz
  tau = off
  ```
