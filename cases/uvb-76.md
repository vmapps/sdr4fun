# UVB-76 listening

## Introduction

UVB-76 (often nicknamed **The Buzzer**) is a mysterious Russian shortwave radio station, best known for its constant buzzing tone and unclear purpose.

It transmits on the shortwave frequency **4625 kHz** and usually broadcasts a repetitive buzzing sound about 25 times per minute, 24 hours a day. From time to time, the buzzing stops and a Russian voice reads sequences of words, names, or numbers.

The station has been active since at least the late 1970s or early 1980s, with some sources suggesting around 1976. Its call sign has changed over time (e.g., UZB-76, UVB-76, MDZhB), but listeners still commonly use the original UVB-76 name. No one knows its true function, but several main theories exist:

- Military communications or a kind of numbers station, sending coded instructions to units or operators
- A “doomsday” or Dead Hand–related system, where the continuous signal might be tied to nuclear deterrence if it stops, though this is speculative
- A technical or ionospheric monitoring signal, possibly linked to scientific or military propagation measurements

## UVB-76 listening

You can listen without any radio gear via continuous internet streams:

- Dedicated UVB-76 listening site that embeds a live receiver on 4625 kHz in USB mode
- Several YouTube channels run 24/7 “The Buzzer 4625 kHz LIVE” streams; searching for “UVB-76 live 4625 kHz” or “The Buzzer live” will surface current ones

These are ideal if you just want to hear it in a browser or on your phone.

If you want more control (change filters, bandwidth, etc.), use a web-based SDR (software-defined radio) or your own SDR hardware and software.

## Quick tutorial

- run the software defined radio
- set center frequency to one `4635 kHz` range
- select `USB` (Upper Side Band) decoding mode
- narrow the filter around the carrier

Reception strength varies with time of day and conditions. Listening to UVB-76 especially at night when propagation on 4–5 MHz is better.

Note: connecintg a decent wire antenna (10–20 m of wire as high as possible) will be helpful.
