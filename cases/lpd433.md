# LPD433 decoding

LPD433 decoding refers to the process of interpreting radio signals transmitted in the LPD433 band, a license-free UHF frequency range around **433 MHz** used by low-power devices like weather stations, doorbells, and remote controls.

## Introduction

LPD433 operates between **433.05 – 434.79 MHz**, allowing short-range, unlicensed communications in many regions. Devices send simple data bursts using modulation like On-Off Keying (OOK), often with Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) or Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to encode bits—short gaps for 0s, long gaps for 1s, or vice versa.

## Decoding LPD433

Signals are captured via software-defined radio (SDR) hardware like RTL-SDR dongles, then demodulated to reveal binary data packets. Tools like rtl_433 automatically detect protocols (over 140 supported), parse timings, and output readable info such as temperature or button presses.

**rtl_433** is an open-source software for Linux/Windows that tunes to 433.92 MHz, decodes packets, and logs data from nearby devices.
