## Introduction

[Software-defined radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) also named SDR is a radio communication system where components that conventionally have been implemented in analog hardware (e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a computer or embedded system.

## Hardware

There are a few hardware devices you could use to start playing with SDR:

* Generic USB DVB-T USB with RTL2832U chipset and R860 tuner
* USB dongles from [RTL-SDR Blog](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/)
* USB dongles from [Nooelec](https://www.nooelec.com/store/)
* from [Nooelec](https://www.nooelec.com/store/)
* HackRF One device from [Great Scott Gadgets](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/)
